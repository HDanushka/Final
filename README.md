Description File Preparation merge the data of test and training, get one data named dataset.

Extract Mean & Standard Deviation Measurements Extract the mean& standard deviation of every column.

Tidy Data Output

Adjust the name of Y 1-6 into correspondent activities. Assign labels to each column of dataset; and establish a separate table with the mean of every activities and subjects.

Assessment Directions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

First download the data, and then merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Deliverables

Please upload a tidy data set according to the instructions in the project description. Please upload your data set as a separate file (do not cut and paste a dataset

directly into the text box, as this may cause errors saving your submission). Please submit a link to a Github repo with the code for performing your analysis. The code should have a file run_analysis.R in the main directory that can be run as

long as the Samsung data is in your working directory. The output should be the tidy data set you submitted for part 1. You should include a README.md in the repo

describing how the script works.
